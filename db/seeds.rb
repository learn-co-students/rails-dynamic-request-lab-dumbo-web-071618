# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database
# with its default values. The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed
# (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
Student.create(first_name: 'Robert\'); DROP', last_name: 'TABLE Students;--')
